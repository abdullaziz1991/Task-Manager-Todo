## Getting Started

Dear maids.cc team,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Engineer Abdulaziz Hallak. I work in the field of designing Android applications from 2021. I have two years of experience as director of the Informatics Department at the Aleppo Chamber of Industry. I am writing to introduce myself after the last task you assigned me. I am happy to inform you that I have successfully completed the task of designing a task management application as requested.

Throughout this process, I wrote clean code and architecture,
State management patterns, performance optimization, handling local storage, writing unit tests...... I hope you like it.

I am very excited to have the opportunity to further contribute to your company. If you need any additional information or if there are other tasks where I can help, please feel free to contact me.
